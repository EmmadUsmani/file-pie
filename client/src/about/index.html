        Hi, I'm
        <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmadusmani/">Emmad</a
        >. I created File Pie out of frustration with the friction in sending
        files, both to my own devices and to other people. I was tired of
        compressing files to send via email, only to get blocked by malware
        filters, and uploading files to privately operated cloud storage
        platforms, having to manually delete them later.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        File Pie simplifies this process: simply upload a file then share a link
        or QR code with the recipient.

        File Pie works using
        <a class="link" href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a>, a browser
        protocal enabling peer to peer connections. This means that files are
        transferred directly to recipients, without ever being sent to a server.
        A signaling server is used to establish a connection between browsers,
        but during this process no information about the file is sent to the
        server. The app is completely

      <h2 class="section-heading">Inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        Two similar projects,
        <a class="link" href="https://file.pizza/">File Pizza</a> and
        <a class="link" href="https://www.sharedrop.io/">Sharedrop</a> served as
        inspirations for File Pie. File Pizza in particular served as an
        inspiration for the design and name. Code from both projects was
        referenced during development, but no source code was used directly.
